# Decide how to prepare apps for mobile application management with Microsoft Intune
You can enable your apps to use mobile application management policies by using either the Intune App Wrapping Tool or the Intune App SDK. Use this information to learn about these two methods and when to use them.

## Intune App Wrapping Tool
The App Wrapping Tool is used primarily for internal line-of-business (LOB) apps. The tool is a command line application that creates a wrapper around the app, which then allows the app to be managed by an Intune mobile application management policy. You don't need the source code to use the tool, but you do need signing credentials.  For more about signing credentials, see the [Intune blog](http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoftintune/archive/2015/02/25/how-to-obtain-the-prerequisites-for-the-intune-app-wrapping-tool-for-ios.aspx). For the App Wrapping Tool documentation, see [Android App Wrapping Tool ](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt147413.aspx) and [iOS App Wrapping Tool](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn878028.aspx).

The App Wrapping Tool does not support Apps in the App or Play Store or features that require development time integration (see the following feature comparison table).

You should use the App Wrapping Tool, rather than the SDK, if the  app has already been written or if the source code isn't available.

## Intune App SDK
The App SDK is designed mainly for customers who have apps in the App or Play stores and want to be able to manage the apps with Intune. However, any app can take advantage of integrating the SDK, even if it’s a LOB app.

To integrate the SDK, you need access to the app’s source code. For instructions on integrating the SDK, see [Microsoft Intune App SDK](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt627769.aspx).

## Feature comparison
This table lists the settings that you can use for the App SDK and App Wrapping Tool.

> [!NOTE]
> The App Wrapping Tool can be used only when you are using  either Intune Standalone or Intune with Configuration Manager.
