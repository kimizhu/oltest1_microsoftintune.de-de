# Manage access to Skype for Business
Use conditional access policy for  **Skype for Business Online** to manage access to Skype for Business Online, based on conditions you specify.

When a targeted user attempts to use Skype for Business Online on their device, the following evaluation occurs:

![](../Image/ConditionalAccess_SkypeforBusiness.png)

The device that needs access to Skype for Business Online must:

-   Be an Android or iOS device.

-   Be enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]

-   Be compliant with any deployed [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] compliance policies

The device state is stored in Azure Active Directory which grants or blocks access, based on the conditions you specify.

If a condition is not met, the user is presented with one of the following messages when they log in:

-   If the device is not enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)], or is not registered in Azure Active Directory, a message is displayed with instructions about how to install the company portal app and enroll.

-   If the device is not compliant, a message is displayed that directs the user to the [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] web portal where they can find information about the problem, and how to remediate it.

## Steps to configure conditional access for Skype for Business Online

### Step 1: Configure Active Directory security groups
Before you start, configure Azure Active Directory security groups for the conditional access policy. You can configure these groups in the **Office 365 admin center**. These groups contain the users that will be targeted, or exempt from the policy. When a user is targeted by a policy, each device they use must be compliant in order to access resources.

You can specify two group types to use for the Skype for Business policy:

-   **Targeted groups** – Contains groups of users to which the policy will apply

-   **Exempted groups** – Contains groups of users that are exempt from the policy (optional)

If a user is in both groups, they will be exempt from the policy.

### Step 2: Configure and deploy a compliance policy
Ensure that you create and deploy a compliance policy to all devices that the Skype for Business Online policy will be targeted to.

> [!NOTE]
> While compliance policies are deployed to [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] groups, conditional access policies are targeted to Azure Active Directory security groups.

For details about how to configure the compliance policy, see [Manage device compliance policies for Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Manage_device_compliance_policies_for_Microsoft_Intune.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have not deployed a compliance policy and then enable the Skype for Business Online policy, all targeted devices will be allowed access.

When you are ready, continue to **Step 3**.

Next, configure the policy to require that only managed and compliant devices can access Skype for Business Online. This policy will be will be stored in Azure Active Directory.

#### <a name="bkmk_spopolicy"></a>

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Policy** &gt; **Conditional Access** &gt; **Skype for Business Online Policy**.

2.  Select **Enable conditional access policy.**.

3.  Under **Device platforms**, you can choose to apply conditional access policy to:

    -   **iOS**

    -   **Android**

4.  Under **Targeted Groups**, click **Modify** to select the Azure Active Directory security groups to which the policy will apply. You can choose to target this to all users or just a select groups of users.

5.  Under **Exempted Groups**, optionally, click **Modify** to select the Azure Active Directory security groups that are exempt from this policy.

6.  When you are done, click **Save**.

You do not have to deploy the conditional access policy, it takes effect immediately.

### Step 4: Monitor the compliance and conditional access policies
In the **Groups** workspace, you can view the conditional access status of your devices.

Select any mobile device group and then, on the **Devices** tab, select one of the following **Filters**:

-   **Devices that are not registered with AAD** – These devices are blocked from Skype for Business Online.

-   **Devices that are not compliant** – These devices are blocked from Skype for Business Online.

-   **Devices that are registered with AAD and compliant** – These devices can access Skype for Business Online.
