# Old - Computer capabilities in Intune
Devices that run Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 can be managed using the Intune client. You can deploy software to your managed computers in a variety of different formats like a Windows Installer, or Windows app package file. You can also deploy links to applications in a store, or links to Web applications.
