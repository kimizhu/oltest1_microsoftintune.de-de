# Stacie What&#39;s New

## Changes and updates to Microsoft Company Portal
The following changes have been made to the company portal apps in this release:

**Windows and Windows Phone**

-   Microsoft automatically collects anonymous data about the performance and use of the Company Portal to improve Microsoft products and services. Your users can turn off data collection by using the Usage Data setting on their device, but administrators have no control over the data collection and cannot change the userâ€™s selection for this setting.

**iOS**

-   The user  enrollment experience has been improved in cases where a user's device has already been enrolled using a method other than the Company Portal app. Users now see a message during enrollment that asks them to identify their device either by choosing their device from the a list of already-enrolled devices, or by selecting **new device**, and then entering their device's serial number.

**Company Portal website**

-   Users who have enrolled their device in Intune can now reset their passcode by using the Company Portal website. Previously, only IT administrators could reset users' passcodes. For instructions, see [Reset your passcode](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt590895.aspx).
