# Control Microsoft Passport settings on devices with Microsoft Intune
[!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)] lets you integrate with Microsoft Passport for Work which is an alternative sign-in method that uses Active Directory, or an Azure Active Directory account to replace a password, smart card, or virtual smart card.

Passport lets you use a **user gesture** to login, instead of a password. A user gesture might be a simple PIN, biometric authentication such as Windows Hello, or an external device such as a fingerprint reader.

[!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] integrates with Passport for Work in two ways:

-   You can use [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] policy to control which gestures users can and cannot use to login

-   You can store authentication certificates in the Passport for Work key storage provider (KSP). For more information, see [Enable access to company resources using certificate profiles with Microsoft Intune](../Topic/Enable_access_to_company_resources_using_certificate_profiles_with_Microsoft_Intune.md).

## To create a Passport for Work policy

1.  In the [Microsoft Intune administration console](https://manage.microsoft.com), click **Admin** &gt; **Mobile Device Management** &gt; **Windows** &gt; **Passport for Work**.

2.  Choose from the following values that will affect all enrolled Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile devices:

    |Setting|Description|
    |-----------|---------------|
    |-   **Disable Passport for Work on enrolled devices**<br />-   **Enable Passport for Work on enrolled devices**|Enables or disables the use of Passport for work on all enrolled Windows 10 and Windows 10 mobile devices. **Important:** This policy is enabled by default and applied to all Windows 10 devices when they enroll.|
    |**Use a Trusted Platform Module (TPM)**|A Trusted Platform Module (TPM) chip provides an additional layer of data security.<br /><br />Choose one of the following values:<br /><br />-   **Required** (default) - Only devices with an accessible TPM can provision Passport for Work.<br />-   **Preferred** - Devices first attempt to use a TPM. If this is not available, they can use software encryption|
    |**Require minimum PIN length**|Specify the minimum number of characters required for the Passport for Work PIN. You must use at least 4 characters (the default value is 6 characters). â€‹|
    |**Require maximum PIN length**|Specify the maximum number of characters allowed for the Passport for Work PIN. You can use up to 127 characters.|
    |**Require lowercase letters in PIN**|Specifies whether lowercase letters must be used  in the Passport for Work PIN. Choose from:<br /><br />-   **Allowed** - Users can use lowercase characters in their PIN.<br />-   **Required** - Users must include at least one lowercase character in their PIN.<br />-   **Not allowed** (default) - Users must not use lowercase characters in their PIN.|
    |**Require uppercase letters in PIN**|Specifies whether uppercase letters must be used  in the Passport for Work PIN. Choose from:<br /><br />-   **Allowed** - Users can use uppercase characters in their PIN.<br />-   **Required** - Users must include at least one uppercase character in their PIN.<br />-   **Not allowed** (default) - Users must not use uppercase characters in their PIN.|
    |**Require special characters in PIN**|Specifies the use of special characters in the PIN. Choose from:<br /><br />Special characters include: **! " # $ % &amp; ' ( ) &#42; + , - . / : ; &lt; = &gt; ? @ [ \ ] ^ _ &#96; { &#124; } ~**.<br /><br />-   **Allowed** - Users can use special characters in their PIN.<br />-   **Required** - Users must include at least one special character in their PIN.<br />-   **Not allowed** (default) - Users must not use special characters in their PIN (this is also the behavior if the setting is not configured).|
    |**PIN expiration (days)**|Specifies the number of days before the device PIN must be changed. The default is 41 days.|
    |**Remember PIN history**|Use this setting to restrict the re-use of previously used PINS. The default is the last 5 PINS used cannot be reused.|
    |**Allow biometric authentication**|Enables biometric authentication such as facial recognition or fingerprint as an alternative to a PIN for Passport for Work. Users must still configure a work PIN in case biometric authentication fails.<br /><br />If set to **Yes**, Passport for Work allows biometric authentication.  If set to **No**, Passport for Work prevents biometric authentication (for all account types).|
    |**Use enhanced anti-spoofing, when available**|Configures whether enhanced anti-spoofing is used on devices that support it.<br /><br />If set to **Yes**, Windows requires all users to use anti-spoofing for facial features when supported.|
    |**Use Remote Passport**|If this option is set to **Yes**, users can use a remote passport to serve as a portable companion device for desktop computer authentication. The desktop computer must be Azure Active Directory joined, and the companion device must be configured with a Passport for Work PIN.|

3.  When you are finished, click **Save**.
