# Help for Managed Apps

## What are managed apps?
To help protect company data on a device that has been enrolled with [!INCLUDE[wit_firstref](../Token/wit_firstref_md.md)], your IT department can use managed apps.

Managed apps work similar to other apps, but must be installed by your IT department after your device enrolls with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)]. A managed app that you install directly on a device will not work with [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)] and will need to be removed and then reinstalled by your IT department using [!INCLUDE[wit_nextref](../Token/wit_nextref_md.md)].

## How do they work?
When data, for example a document, spreadsheet, etc., is protected by managed apps, you must use a managed app to access that data. If a managed app is required (and installed), it will open automatically. If a required app is not available, certain operations, like opening a document or accessing a web link from within a managed document, might not be available.

## When might I use them?
The following list includes common configurations and options that can be managed and that could affect your interactions with content and company resources from your device:

-   Access to specific websites

-   Transfers of data between apps

-   **Save as** operations

-   **Copy** and **paste** operations

-   PIN access requirements

-   Login using company credentials

-   Backup to the cloud

-   Screen capture events

-   Data encryption requirements

The following are common apps that your IT department might manage:

-   Managed web browser

-   Managed image viewer

-   Managed PDF viewer

-   Managed AV player

## Do I have to do anything to use them?
Contact your IT department for more information about the managed apps on your device.
