# Manage app access to SharePoint Online
You can choose which apps should be allowed to access SharePoint Online and the users who are affected by the policy.  This topic gives you step by step instructions on how to set up app access to SharePoint Online service..

## Create SharePoint Online policy

1.  Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2.  From **Browse**, click **Intune**. This opens the **Intune mobile application management** blade and the **Settings** blade. From the **Settings** blade, click **SharePoint Online** to open the SharePoint Online blade.

3.  On the **Allowed apps** blade, first select whether you want to allow all apps, or if only certain apps should have access to SharePoint Online. If you select to allow only certain apps to have access, you will be presented with a list of apps that you can choose from. Select one or more apps from the list and save your changes.

From the **SharePoint Online** blade, click **Exempted user groups**. Click **Add user group** to open the list of user groups. Select the groups you want to exempt from this restriction, and click **Select** to create the access policy for SharePoint Online.
